EXPLANATION OF POLYMORPHISM WITH USE OF VIRTUAL KEYWORD

1.Both ninja and monster are the derived class and derive all the properties of the base class Enemy . 

2. Enemy *enemy1 = &ninja; <= This line means that the ninja object created is also accessed by the enemy1 object
which belongs to the class Enemy

3. enemy1 -> setAttackPower(25); <= This line means that as the attackPower can be only modified by called the object 
of the class . We do that and then we can access this attackPower in the Ninja class as the enemy1 object is pointing to the 
address of the ninja object of class Ninja.

4. enemy1 -> attack(); <= This line means that we called the virtual attack(){} function in the class Enemy and now 
as we know that enemy1 points to the ninja object the attack() will be directly directed the attack() function within the 
class Ninja and carry out its particular functioning.
