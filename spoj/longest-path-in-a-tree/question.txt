You are given an unweighted, undirected tree. Write a program to output the length of the longest path 
(from one node to another) in that tree. The length of a path in this case is number of edges we traverse from 
source to destination.

Input
The first line of the input file contains one integer N --- number of nodes in the tree (0 < N <= 10000). 
Next N-1 lines contain N-1 edges of that tree --- Each line contains a pair (u, v) means there is an edge between 
node u and node v (1 <= u, v <= N).

Output
Print the length of the longest path on one line.
