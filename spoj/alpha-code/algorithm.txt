THE METHOD USED IN THE PROCESS OF DECODING THE ALPHA CODES IS RECURSION. 

1. Intialize a counter array of n+1 size where n is the length of string to caclulate all the subproblem components.
2. Initialize count[0] = 1 and count[1] = 1
3. Traverse the loop from index 2 to n+1
4. For every last digit if it's greater than zero then perform recursion for n-1 digits.
5. If the last digit is less than 7 and previous to it is either 1 or 2 then perform recursion for n-2 digits.
6. If the last digit is 0 and previous to it is either 1 or 2 then perform recursion for n-2 digits as well. 
7. return count[n] which stores the final count for the number of decodings for the digits.
