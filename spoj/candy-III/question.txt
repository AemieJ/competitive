 teacher realized that he has to step in: "Everybody, listen! Put all the candies you have on this table here!"

Soon, there was quite a large heap of candies on the teacher's table. "Now, I will divide the candies into N 
equal heaps and everyone will get one of them." announced the teacher.

"Wait, is this really possible?" wondered some of the smarter kids.
