To count the trailing zeros in the factorial of a number , it is not required to find the factorial of a number.

1. Intialize count to 0. 
2. Run a loop from i to number/i>0 where i are the multiples of 5
3. To count the number of trailing zeros it is simple as number/i and increament it to your count variable.
4.The resultant count is the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a number.
