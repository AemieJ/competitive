factorial(n):

1. Create an array ‘res[ ]’ of MAX size where MAX is number of maximum digits in output.
2. Initialize value stored in ‘res[ ]’ as 1 and initialize ‘res_size’ (size of ‘res[ ]’) as 1.
3. Do following for all numbers from x = 2 to n......

a) Multiply x with res[ ] and update res[ ] and res_size to store the multiplication result.

multiply(res[ ], x)

1. Initialize carry as 0.
2. Do following for i = 0 to res_size – 1 .....

a) Find value of res[i] * x + carry. Let this value be prod.

b) Update res[i] by storing last digit of prod in it.

c) Update carry by storing remaining digits in carry.

3. Put all digits of carry in res[ ] and increase res_size by number of digits in carry
