# OTHER PERMUTATIONS 

Let the range of numbers be defined as: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

## ROTATE 
When rotate() function is used, it takes the last element and places at the beginning
```
Result: [9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

## SHUFFLE
This outputs the result in a random order generation.
```
Result: [2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]
```

## REVERSE 
This reverses the entire order of the range of numbers
```
Result: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

## NEXT_PERMUTATION & PREV_PERMUTATION
Using next_permutation(), you get the next order of generation and prev_permutation(), you get the previous order of generation in the range 
of numbers.
